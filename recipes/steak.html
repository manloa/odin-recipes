    <h3>Steak is one of the best meals you can eat! I enjoy eating steak with a refreshing beverage on a beautiful summer night.</h3>
    <p>One of the many benefits to cooking a steak is how simple it can be. 
    <p>All you need is a simple grill, a couple ingredients and a good recipe.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>12 oz Ribeye</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Let the steak come to room temperature - take it out of the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before you want to cook it - preheat the grill on high for at least ten minutes - screaming hot!!</li>
        <li>Season as desired, place on the grill over high heat and close the lid. Wait exactly one minute.</li>
        <li>Turn the meat 90 degrees with tongs, never use a fork! Close the lid and wait one minute more. This makes those professional-looking hash marks.</li>
        <li>Repeat on the other side.</li>
        <li>Move to an indirect heat source - turn off the burner under the steaks but leave the others on high - you want the grill temp to be about 400 degrees and cook 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare. If you like your steak more than medium-rare (and we certainly don't recommend this), continue cooking on indirect heat and use an instant-read thermometer to achieve the desired temperature.</li>
        <li>Let the steak rest under foil for 5-10 minutes. We recommend slicing against the grain before serving.</li>
    </ol>
